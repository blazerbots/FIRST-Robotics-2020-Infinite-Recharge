# FIRST-Robotics-2020-Infinite-Recharge
This is the repository for FRC team 3807 Overland Blazerbots' robot code during the 2020-21 Infinite Recharge game.

----
robot.py is the primary file housing the main class and is what runs upon connecting to the robot.

MethodsRobot.py is as the name implies houses the bulk of the code and the primary methods that are called in robot.py

ports.py is a small file containing two dictionaries that assign the port ID of each motor on the robot to a readable and useable name.


Please pardon the mess of code. I'm not exactly a shining example of best programming practices. I had a tendency of constantly moving about
the code, moving, removing, and adding different things as I had ideas. Don't mind the rather strange comments either, I knew I needed to
document the code for future use, but I wasn't really that "into" it so I was very half-hearted in making it. Therefore the code isn't
100% documented, and some of the comments are definitely questionable in regards to their professionalism. - Gavin(gburg3ss)
